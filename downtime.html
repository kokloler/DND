<p>Being an adventurer isn't always about fighting goblins and defeating the evil necromancer, sometimes its also about preparing, studying and working small jobs.<br>
    Adventurers don't just sit around and do nothing while they are not on a quest after all. <br>
    There is lots to do and maybe even money to be made. You can work, train, do research, make contacts and maybe even gamble some of that well earned cash away. <br>
    <br>
    Downtime is very important, it can be used to power up, recover from injuries, hone skills and much more.<br>
    You as an adventurer might not always be ready for battle and might want a weeks rest.<br>
    If you decide to not go on any quests for the week you can spend your week doing a downtime activity, <br>
    though there are always risks involved doing these things.<br>
    <br>
    if a person is not interested in doing any quests for a week or there are no quests available they can on Sunday/Monday decide to do a downtime activity for the coming week, <br>
    at the end of the week you will see how well your downtime went and if there were any complications. <br>
    <br>
    For example: "Rick Blaze stumbles back into the Laughing Beholder after a brutal fight, <br>
    he seems to have contracted a disease of some kind and decides that next week he will take a rest and takes a relaxation downtime.<br>
    he will have to cough up a few gold to support the modest lifestyle but he has plenty from the quest he completed. <br>
    At the end of the week he feel revitalized and has recovered from the disease and is ready to get on the road again."<br>
    <br>
    Another example: "Louise Pasrty's favourite mallet was destroyed in the last adventure when swinging into an acidic ooze,<br>
    he decides he will get another one and enchant this one! He takes a few weeks downtime to craft a new mallet, <br>
    he uses his woodcarver tool proficiency to create his mallet and then he start enchanting it,<br>
    Putting down some money for some material component he discoverers he requires one more thing, The beak of an owlbear.<br>
    He decides to got to the tavern owner and put in a request for a quest, <br>
    He needs an owlbear beak stat! the next day he and a few of his friends head out and slay an owlbear, <br>
    he rewards each of them with 10 gp and a lovely meal. he then takes another 2 weeks of downtime to finish his creation,
    THE MALLET OF EGG DESTROYING is created and he will never have to buy another mallet ever again."<br>
    <br>
