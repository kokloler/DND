    <p>on quests you can encounter magic items. on the end of the quest these will be divided amongst  you. <br>
        I will ask all of you individually if you want the magic item or not. If multiple people want it, it will be raffled. <br>
        When someone skips a magic item they get one point, if multiple people want a magic item you randomise it with every point being an equal share <br>
        (every gets 1 point added to their odds just so everyone has a chance) <br>
        if someone gets a magic item they lose all their points that they have accumulated </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For example player 1 has 3 points player 2 had 7 and they both want the item player 1 had 4/12 odds, player 2 has 8/12 odds, <br>
            you randomize it with those odds and player 2 gets it, player 2 gets the item and loses their point, player 1 doesnâ€™t lose his points.<br>
